# 🛠️ DevOps Bash Game – System Health Check CLI

A fun, interactive, and **professional-grade Bash game** designed to teach and demonstrate real-world DevOps and Linux administration skills.  

This project simulates a **DevOps Operations Terminal**, where the user navigates a menu-based CLI to perform health checks, view reports, and monitor disk space — just like a Junior DevOps Engineer would in production.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Learn Bash scripting by building a hands-on, real-world tool  
✅ Showcase DevOps automation skills in interviews or your GitHub portfolio  
✅ Practice working with system commands, user input, logging, alerting, and menu interfaces  
✅ Make it fun, memorable, and educational

## 📋 Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔧 View System Status | Shows memory, disk usage, and uptime |
| 🧠 Top 5 Processes | Lists top 5 CPU-heavy processes |
| 📉 Disk Usage Alerting | Warns if disk usage exceeds 80% |
| 📄 Save Health Reports | Logs a full report to a timestamped file |
| 🗂️ View Past Reports | Opens and scrolls through saved reports interactively |
| 🎮 Menu-Based UX | Clean CLI interface with colored outputs |

## 🚀 Run the Game

```bash
chmod +x system_health_game.sh
./system_health_game.sh
📁 Where Reports Are Saved
All reports are saved in:

bash
Copy
Edit
~/devops-health-logs/
Each file is timestamped and includes:

Memory stats

Disk usage

Uptime

Top processes

Disk space alerts

📚 Concepts Covered
This project helps reinforce:

df, free, uptime, ps, awk, sed, less, read, mkdir, tr, head, tail

Logging and redirection

Conditional logic and control flow

User input handling

Bash functions and menu systems

Professional output formatting

🧠 Why This Matters in DevOps
✅ Infrastructure monitoring
✅ Proactive alerting (disk space)
✅ Logging for audit and troubleshooting
✅ Command-line automation
✅ Reusable functions for scripting pipelines

🏗️ Project Ideas for Expansion
🔁 Add a cron job to run health checks daily

📤 Integrate with email or Slack notifications

🌐 Serve log reports via a local web dashboard (e.g., Python Flask)

📈 Push reports into Grafana or ELK Stack
